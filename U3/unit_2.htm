<p>Text on what this unit is about. </p>
<p>In this unit I have had to revise for an upcoming exam that was all about the 
online world, There are many ways that I revised for this exam and it was by 
going on to the website known as know it all ninja to revise and there was also 
other ways that I could've revised and it was going to be doing quizlet to quiz 
where I am at with the online world exam. The main way I revised is by doing 
multiple mock exams from past exams that had questions very similar to what I 
would be doing in the exam and I did these in class with my teacher Dale. </p>
