<p>In this Unit I created my app and first of all I had to include a plan for an 
an app I was creating and it included multiple things like target audience etc, 
I then created my app and it was an app that was for children on code.org, this 
was the name of the website I used to create my game. I then reviewed this by 
adding saying how it went and whart I could do to improve it. </p>
